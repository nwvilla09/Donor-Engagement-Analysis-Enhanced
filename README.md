# Donor Engagement Analysis Enhanced

## Project Overview

This project uses Python to analyze donor data for optimizing fundraising efforts in a nonprofit setting, such as a health foundation. It generates insights into donor segmentation, engagement metrics (e.g., response rates, interactions), average donations, and retention for supporting targeted communications and stewardship strategies. The analysis leverages a simulated dataset enhanced with engagement labels to inform decision-making in donor management.

Key goals:

- Segment donors using ML clustering to enable personalized appeals.
- Visualize metrics like average donations by income level, engagement distribution, and interactions vs. donations.
- Summarize data for reporting on campaign effectiveness and ROI (e.g., high-engagement donors contribute more).

## ML-Based Aspect: Donor Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

The machine learning (ML) component focuses on unsupervised clustering to automatically group donors into meaningful segments based on their attributes. This directly supports the job responsibilities of designing and optimizing donor segmentation strategies using CRM and data analytics for targeted appeals and personalized communications.

- **Why ML?** Traditional rule-based segmentation (e.g., by income alone) can miss nuanced patterns. ML clustering identifies hidden groups, such as "high-value frequent interactors" or "low-engagement high-potential donors," allowing for data-driven decisions on fundraising tactics like customized stewardship or retention efforts.
  
- **How It Works:**
  
  - **Input Features:** The model uses key donor attributes: Age, DonationAmount, NumInteractions, and ResponseRate. These are standardized (scaled) to ensure fair weighting.
  - **Algorithm:** K-Means clustering from scikit-learn is applied with 3 clusters (configurable; e.g., representing low, medium, and high-potential segments).
    - **What is K-Means Clustering?** It's a simple ML algorithm that sorts data into a fixed number of groups (clusters) by looking for similarities—like putting similar donors together based on their behavior. It works by repeatedly adjusting group centers until the data points are as close as possible to their group's center.
    - **What is scikit-learn?** A free, beginner-friendly Python library that provides ready-to-use tools for ML tasks, such as clustering, without needing to build everything from scratch.
    - K-Means partitions the data by minimizing intra-cluster variance, grouping similar donors together.
  - **Process:**
    1. Load and preprocess the data (e.g., clipping values for integrity).
    2. Scale features.
    3. Fit the K-Means model and assign each donor to a cluster (labeled as 0, 1, or 2 in the output).
  - **Benefits for the Role:** This enables analysis of segment-specific metrics (e.g., average donations per cluster) to measure communication effectiveness, inform ROI on campaigns, and track engagement—aligning with overseeing donor interactions and providing strategy analysis.

This ML approach can be extended to real CRM data (e.g., from Raiser's Edge) for production use, potentially integrating with tools like Tableau for visualizing segments.

## Files

- `donor_data.csv`: Simulated raw dataset with donor attributes (e.g., age, income, donations, engagement).
- `donor_analysis.py`: Script to process data, perform ML segmentation, generate summary CSV, and create visualizations.
- `donor_summary.csv`: Output summary with aggregated metrics by income level (generated by script). (Note: This is non-ML; focuses on basic aggregation.)
- `donor_clustered.csv`: Output with ML-assigned donor segments (generated by script). This file directly reflects the ML aspect—see below for details.
- Visualization files (generated by script):
  - `avg_donation_bar.png`: Bar chart of average donations by income level.
  - `engagement_pie.png`: Pie chart of donor engagement distribution.
  - `interactions_scatter.png`: Scatter plot of interactions vs. donation amounts.

## How the ML Aspect Reflects in Output Files

- **Primary Output: `donor_clustered.csv`**
  
  - This CSV is an enhanced version of the input `donor_data.csv`, with an added 'Segment' column containing the ML-generated cluster labels (integers like 0, 1, 2).
  - **Reflection of ML:** Each row shows how the K-Means algorithm grouped the donor based on their features. For example:
    - Segment 0 might represent "young, low-interaction donors" with lower average donations.
    - Segment 1 could be "older, high-engagement donors" with higher response rates.
    - Segment 2 might capture "mid-age, variable donors" for targeted re-engagement.
  - **Usage for Job:** You can analyze this file to create targeted communication plans (e.g., filter by segment for personalized appeals) or compute segment-level ROI (e.g., sum donations per segment). Import into CRM or visualization tools to track changes over time.
- **Indirect Reflection in Other Outputs:**
  
  - While `donor_summary.csv` and visualizations are based on basic aggregation (e.g., by IncomeLevel), you could extend the script to summarize/visualize by ML segments instead (e.g., average donations per cluster). This would provide deeper insights into engagement metrics and campaign performance.
  - For instance, the scatter plot (`interactions_scatter.png`) could be recolored by ML segments to visually identify clusters.

## How to Run

1. Place `donor_data.csv` in the same directory.
2. Run `python donor_analysis.py`.
3. View generated CSV files and PNG visualizations.

## Dataset Details

Simulated data includes 100 records with columns: DonorID, Age, IncomeLevel, DonationAmount, NumInteractions, ResponseRate, Engaged (0/1 label).

This project demonstrates skills relevant to nonprofit data management, such as ensuring data integrity, analyzing engagement, and using analytics for fundraising success.
